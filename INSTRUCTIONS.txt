HOW TO RUN THE BLOB DEMO PROJECT
================================

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the Blob Demo on a Linux computer.

1. PREREQUISITES
----------------
You need to have a C++ compiler and OpenGL libraries installed.
Open your Terminal and run the following command to install them (for Ubuntu/Debian):

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential freeglut3-dev

2. COMPILE THE PROJECT
----------------------
Once the installation is complete, navigate to the folder containing this project in your Terminal.
Run the following command to build the project:

    make

This will create an executable file named 'blob_demo'.

3. RUN THE PROJECT
------------------
To start the simulation, run:

    ./blob_demo

4. CLEAN UP (Optional)
----------------------
If you want to remove the compiled files and start over, run:

    make clean
