PROCEDURE FOR RUNNING ON MACOS (ARM64)
=====================================

1. IDENTIFIED THE ISSUE
   The error "exec format error" occurred because the original 'blob_demo' binary 
   was compiled for Linux x86_64, which is incompatible with macOS ARM64.

2. REMOVED INCOMPATIBLE BINARY
   Command: rm blob_demo

3. INSTALLED DEPENDENCIES
   The project requires OpenGL and GLUT. On macOS, these are available as 
   frameworks, but 'freeglut' provides better compatibility for this project.
   Command: brew install freeglut

4. UPDATED THE BUILD SYSTEM (Makefile)
   The Makefile was modified to:
   - Detect the operating system (Darwin for Mac).
   - Link against native macOS frameworks: '-framework OpenGL -framework GLUT'.
   - Include Homebrew library and header paths: '-L/opt/homebrew/opt/freeglut/lib -lglut'.

5. UPDATED SOURCE HEADERS (include/gl/glut.h)
   Modified the header to correctly locate OpenGL on Mac, as macOS uses 
   '<OpenGL/gl.h>' instead of '<GL/gl.h>'.

6. COMPILED THE PROJECT
   Command: make clean && make
   This generated a new 'blob_demo' binary specifically for your Mac.

7. HOW TO RUN
   Command: ./blob_demo
